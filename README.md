# Clicker-Game-Project

Special Features of "Le Jeu De Clicker" (The Clicker Game)

The Background hsan animation. Clicking the targes there doesn't affect the score.
There are four difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Hell
Harder the game, faster the targets every time you click.
The size also affect the score/click: smaller the target, more points you'll get per click
The size can be adjusted and smallest size earns 10 points/click while the largest one earns only 1 point/click
You are given with four lives in the beginning.
There is a nyan cat flying through sometimes out of no where. Click Nyan Cat to get extra one more heart.
Each difficulty has its own image and background music.
Other than these special features, my project is just the same as the other's.

Time taken: 21 hours
